### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

I am a recent graduate student studying **Urban Spatial Analytics** at the University of Pennsylvania. I have a strong passion for exploring the intersection of **demographics, cities, transportation, and digital products**. This repository serves as a collection of my projects and analyses in these areas.

### About Me
I am a dedicated and curious learner with a keen interest in understanding the dynamics of urban environments. I believe that data-driven analysis and spatial tools play a crucial role in unraveling the complexities of cities and informing decision-making processes. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in urban planning, spatial analysis, and data science, which I continuously apply in my projects.

### Repository Overview
In this repository, you will find a range of projects and analyses focused on various aspects of urban spatial analytics. Some of the key areas of exploration include:

- :construction: **Cities**: [Precision-Forecast](https://github.com/zhaxinge/Precision-Forecast) Investigating urban systems, land use patterns, urban design, and the interplay of various factors shaping urban environments.
- :train2: **Transportation**: [Predictive-Parking-Occupancy](https://github.com/zhaxinge/Predictive-Parking-Occupancy), [xy-scooter](https://github.com/zhaxinge/xy-scooter) Analyzing transportation networks, mobility patterns, and the impact of transportation infrastructure on urban dynamics and accessibility.
- :house: **Housing**:  [Kenya-Land-Value](https://github.com/zhaxinge/Kenya-Land-Value) Understanding the socio-economic characteristics of urban populations and exploring their implications on urban development and planning.

### Contact
I am always open to collaborations, discussions, and feedback. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach out via email at [ssee0132@gmail.com] or connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/xinge-zhang-b26a4521a).
